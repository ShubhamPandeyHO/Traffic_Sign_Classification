# Traffic_Sign_Classification
Prepare the dataset
The first step is to prepare the dataset. This involves splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Typically, the training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model during training, and the test set is used to evaluate the model after training.

For this dataset, you can split the data into a 70% training set, 15% validation set, and 15% test set. You can use a random split to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets are representative of the overall dataset.

Once the data is split, you need to preprocess the images. This may involve resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and converting the images to a format that the CNN model can understand.

Build the CNN model
Next, you need to build the CNN model. There are many different CNN architectures, but a simple CNN architecture that can be used for traffic sign classification is as follows:

Input layer Convolutional layer (32 filters, 3x3 kernel size) Max pooling layer (2x2 pooling size) Convolutional layer (64 filters, 3x3 kernel size) Max pooling layer (2x2 pooling size) Flatten layer Dense layer (128 neurons, ReLU activation) Output layer (58 neurons, softmax activation) This CNN model has two convolutional layers, each followed by a max pooling layer. The convolutional layers learn to extract features from the images, and the max pooling layers reduce the size of the feature maps. The flatten layer converts the feature maps into a one-dimensional vector. The dense layer learns to classify the feature vectors into the different traffic sign classes.

Train the CNN model
Once the CNN model is built, you need to train the model on the training data. This involves feeding the training images and their corresponding labels to the model and adjusting the model's parameters so that it can accurately predict the labels of the training data.

You can use a variety of different optimizers to train the CNN model. A popular optimizer for training CNN models is Adam.


Evaluate the CNN model
Once the CNN model is trained, you need to evaluate its performance on the validation set. This will give you an idea of how well the model will generalize to new data.

To evaluate the model, you can calculate the accuracy of the model on the validation set. The accuracy is the percentage of validation images that the model correctly classifies.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you can use a basic CNN model to classify traffic signs using the given dataset. You can expect to get decent validation accuracy using this approach.

Here are some additional tips for improving the performance of your CNN model:

Use a larger dataset. The more data you have, the better the model will be able to learn the patterns in the data. Use a more complex CNN architecture. There are many different CNN architectures that you can use. More complex architectures typically have more convolutional layers and more neurons in the dense layers. Use data augmentation. Data augmentation is a technique that can be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset. This can help to improve the performance of the model and prevent overfitting. Use regularization techniques. Regularization techniques can help to prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models. Optimize the hyperparameters. The hyperparameters of the CNN model, such as the learning rate and the number of epochs, can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. You can use a variety of different techniques to optimize the hyperparameters.
